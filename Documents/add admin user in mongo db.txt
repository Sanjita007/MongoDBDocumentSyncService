Steps to add admin user in mongodb server
1. Open command prompt

2. Type the command 
	mongo "mongodb://mongodb_server_ip:mongodb_port"
	Example: mongo "mongodb://localhost:27017"
	=> mongodb_port: Port in which mongodb is running
	=> mongodb_server_ip: Mongo db server ip

3. Navigate to admin database with the following command
	use admin

4. Add user using the following command
	db.createUser({user : "admin_user_name",pwd : "admin_password",roles : [{role : "userAdminAnyDatabase", db : "admin"}, "readWriteAnyDatabase"],mechanisms:[ "SCRAM-SHA-1"] })
			
	=> admin_user_name: name for the admin user
	=> admin_password: admin user password
	=> everything else must remain the same or please look into "mechanisms"

5. Check if the newly created credentials are working or not with the following command
	mongodb://admin_user_name:admin_password@mongodb_server:mongodb_port/?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1
	Example: mongo mongodb://myUserAdmin:abc123@localhost:27017/?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1
	=> Please look into the authentication mechanisms in mongo db 

Note: Please look furthur into topic of "preventing connection to mongo db without proper authentication"
